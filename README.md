# CalculatorUsingDevops

This projectâ€™s main goal is to create a scientific calculator programme using DevOps tools. 

The goal is to learn, understand, and apply DevOps tools to Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment, and Continuous Monitoring.

This project mainly focuses on building the Calculator project using Devops framework.

You can use any set of DevOps tool chains you want, but the pipeline would be the same. 

The pipeline includes using a source control management tool - like GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket etc   

Testing - test your code using either JUnit, Selenium, PyUnit and many more

Build - build your code using tool like Maven, Gradle, Ant and many more

Continuous Integration - Continuous integrate your code using tool like Jenkins, GitLab CLI, Travis CLI, and many more

Containerize - Containerize your code using Docker

Push your created Docker image to Docker hub.

Deployment - Do configuration management and deployment using either Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Rundeck. 

Using these do configuration management and pull your docker image and run it on the managed hosts.

For Deployment you can either do it on your local machine or on Kubernetes cluster or OpenStack cloud. 

You can also use Amazon AWS or Google Cloud or some other 3rd party cloud.

Monitoring - for monitoring use the ELK stack. Use a log file to do the monitoring. Generate the log file for your mini project and pass in your ELK stack.
